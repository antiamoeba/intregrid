# intregrid
Hello. This is a discontinued project for mine. For some reason I can't quite seem to find the latest version, this is a little bit buggy (sometimes you need to refresh the page for notes to show up and the like). However, it should still have some of the main functionality.

This was built in Node.js (Express), Socket.io, and Mongodb. The goal of intregrid is to be your desktop on the web. With "notes" that you can drag along your screen to your heart's content, intregrid is a site where you can return to from every computer to view your notes, emails, and the like. You can also share pages with other users, who can update the same notes in real time!

I'm trying to find a more recent version of this code, no guarantees.
